# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI Agents when working with code in this
repository.

## Update rule

Update `AGENTS.md` when:

- You make significant changes that needs to be remembered across session.
- You made a mistake that should not be repeated.
- The user told you a new rule that should be remembered.

> Note: `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to `AGENTS.md`.

## Engineering Principles

These principles guide all implementation decisions in this project:

- **Law of Demeter**: A module should know as little as possible about the
  internal structure of other modules. Reduce coupling.
- **Principle of Least Astonishment**: Code should behave in a way other
  developers would reasonably expect.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Split a system into distinct parts, each handling
  a specific concern.
- **Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil**: Optimize only when there
  is evidence it matters. Readability and correctness come first.
- **Defensive Programming**: Assume inputs, dependencies, and environments may
  fail or misbehave. Validate and safeguard at system boundaries.
- **Design for Testability**: Structure code so it is easy to verify
  automatically. Testable code tends to be more modular and loosely coupled.
- **KISS**: Avoid unnecessary complexity. Simplicity is better than cleverness.
- **YAGNI**: Do not build features until they are actually needed.
- **DRY**: Avoid duplication. Code that repeats itself is harder to maintain.

## Behavioral guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with
project-specific instructions or explicit user requests as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial
tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes,
simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it
work") require constant clarification.
